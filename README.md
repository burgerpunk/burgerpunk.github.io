Use the standard template (standard_template.html) when composing new layers.
Use https://www.textfixer.com/html/convert-text-html.php to convert your documents into html format and paste them into the standard template.

Any html layer request not using the standard template will be denied.

Read the basics on HTML and git before opening a pull request or commiting files:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-basics/
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/git/

Here is an advanced git resource for contributors:
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

First some *GUIDELINES* *READ THIS BEFORE CONTRIBUTING ANYTHING*:
1. You do NOT talk about BURGERPUNK with /tv/.
2. You do NOT talk about BURGERPUNK with /pol/.
3. Put your title in a header tag (h2) as specified in the standard template.
4. Name your contribution as layer_XX.html, where XX is some number not used by another layer.
5. If modifying existing html try not to replace the message / change the meaning of the another author's layer, edits and additions are encouraged, but only if you modify the html file yourself.
6. If you are too lazy to run your document through https://www.textfixer.com/html/convert-text-html.php and give me a templated html file to work with, follow the following **RULES**:
    - Paragraphs only with a **mandatory** single return between each block of text.
    - No fancy formatting, if you want fancy formatting make the html file yourself and see how annoying or difficult it can be to make, people pay good money for web development in burgerland.
    - At this point in time, no images.
    - I will not accept non html formatted edits to layers that are already in the book. I do not have time to constantly modify layers. If you want to modify a layer, modify the html and open a pull request.
7. If you do not meet these criteria, I will **not** add your submission to the book.
8. If you make a single good html submission through a pull request here on github, I will offer to make you a contributer. This means that you can freely add layers and edit existing layers in the project.

Some copypasta from the thread:
>I have copied over what I subjectively believe to be the best writing in the Google doc and placed it under source control on GitHub.

>The unfortunate reality is that Google docs is a terrible way to collaborate on writing. This is because Google docs is not source controlled, meaning that anyone can vandalize it in myriad ways (mass replace or mass deletion) undoing hours of writing through their "creative" trolling.

>In contrast, hosting the project on GitHub allows us to keep the movement alive while it is still nascent lest it become stillborn due to (what I believe are) idiot /pol/ and /tv/ trolls.

>This is not an elitist project in any sense and I do NOT claim to know what is best for BurgerPunk or that I am now the Burger King who gatekeeps the project.

>I am INVITING any anon who makes a real contribution as an HTML file to join the project as a contributor on GitHub and help me curate the project.

>That being said, I cannot do this myself, and I CANNOT continue to sift the Google Doc every hour. I NEED other technically minded anons and writers to assist me if the BurgerPunk project is to succeed.

>TLDR: Google Docs is shit. Go to https://github.com/burgerpunk/burgerpunk.github.io and make pull requests!
