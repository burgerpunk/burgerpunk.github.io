<p>Devin was having trouble memorizing the lines for his spontaneous conversation with AIDS patient Charlie. Keepin It Real wasn't usually this scripted, Devin's rashness, plentiful free booze and the suggestions of producers had previously been enough. The part in episode 3 where Devin had drunkenly driven a dune buggy through the plate glass window of a Tower Records, crucial as it would keep Devin a regular feature of &ldquo;where are they now?&rdquo; lists for decades to come, had been almost entirely improve. The sponsorship deal had only required that Devin drive some kind of vehicle past Tower Records.</p>

<p>Devin had been told to sit on the far end of the L-shaped couch that took up two walls of their beach house living room. This would keep the Dr. Pepper bottles in the shot no matter what camera the producers chose to use. Charlie would sit a few feet away from him in a folding chair. That part was easy. But the producers kept drilling him with more shit - what to say, how to say it. They claimed that as the &quot;meathead&quot; it was very important that he come to &quot;understand&quot; Charlie. This was a crucial scene, possibly main thing for the entire season.</p>

<p>Devin was getting worried though. What if being seen so close to Charlie meant he would get less pussy after the show aired? The producers nodded appreciatively at the question and claimed that chicks loved a guy with a sensitive side. The scene was about to start anyway, no turning back now.</p>

<p>&quot;It sucks to like have the thing that you have, you know, I'm glad that doctors have said that I can't get it just by sitting here with you like this.&quot; Devin said.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, it's nice to know that you care. And, no, people can't get acquired immune deficiency syndrome just from sitting in the same place where someone who has it has sat or even by drinking from the same glass,&quot; Charlie replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Cut! Good start guys,&quot; the producer said. Devin was beginning to relax, he wasn't exactly getting the lines right but the producers didn't seem to care that much. For the next part he would need to be holding the Dr. Pepper bottle he would eventually swap back and forth with Charlie. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey, what if I fill half of this with Wild Turkey and we act like he didn't know?&quot; Devin suggested. The producers laughed and nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Make it Bacardi, they actually pay us,&quot; one of them said.</p>
